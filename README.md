CityHow
===========

<p><strong>CityHow</strong><br/>
CityHow is a light-weight platform for city employees to find and share information that helps improve their work quality of life. The topics are things people need to know, like how to book a conference room or set up a City Zipcar account. These topics are often too specific for HR manuals and not significant enough to be part of a city's knowledge sharing system.</p>

<p>See the beta site <a href="http://cityhow.org">at cityhow.org</a>. Content and feature development is ongoing.</p> 
	
<p><strong>Installation</strong><br/>
CityHow is running on Wordpress and makes extensive use of the Formidable Pro plugin (among others).</p>
<p>To get it running, you'll need a license for the Formidable Pro plugin.</p>
<p>You'll also need some detailed information from the CityHow database. Detailed documentation is on the way.</p>
